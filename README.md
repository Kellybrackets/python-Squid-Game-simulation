## Project Overview  
This Python simulator brings the high-stakes drama of *Squid Game* to your terminal, featuring faithful recreations of the show's most intense challenges. Designed as both an entertaining game and a demonstration of Python fundamentals, it includes:  

- **Red Light, Green Light**: Timed movement with instant elimination  
- **Tug of War**: Team-based probability battle  
- **Player Progression**: Track wins/losses across multiple games  
- **Randomized Difficulty**: Each playthrough offers unique challenges  

Built entirely with Python's standard library (`random`, `time`, `sys`), it's lightweight and runs instantly without complex dependencies.
